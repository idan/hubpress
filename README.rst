Hubpress
========

Hubpress is a github-driven, django-based blog

Yes, it's time for Yet Another blog engine. This one boasts some features that I wanted and couldn't find elsewhere

Lately, there are some awesome static site generator projects like [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). There's even a Python variant, [Hyde](https://github.com/hyde/hyde).

These are great if you want to manage your whole site through them, but integrating them with an existing Django site looked painful.

I wanted the familiarity of Django for the site, and the convenience of editing in iA Writer and pushing with git.
